# Chemistry-Engine
This is a simple very, over simplified, mini program, that focuses, in mutating, and transforming objects, and changing their properties, through the equation of 

modifiedObj = element + oldObj; 
an object being, pretty much anything, an arrow, a sword whatever. 
and an element being things like Water, Fire, Lightening. and basically a set of rules, that are supposed to mutate things. 

the code, is documented and commented out

this project, is open source(but a thank you, and a mention to me would be really nice), and for anyone, and everyone to contribute to, if you're interested into improving the code, please do either add comments, or do it directly, and push up. 

or if you simply want to add comments, and share your thoughts, it would be more than welcomed. 
or as a last idea, feel free to add your thoughts into the thoughts *Suggestions And Improvements* text.

final note: this was built on a Console Application C#
